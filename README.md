# Artificial-Intelligence-Project

Project carried out in M1, consisting in developing and training an AI to drive a car on a circuit, as quickly as possible. The driver evolves according to the 5 laser beams d1, d2, d3, d4 and d5 allowing him to calculate the distances around him.

The circuit corresponds to the "JuniaRacer.py" file and the driver to the "pauline.py" file in the drivers file (and the training of the model in the "entrainement" folder).
The AI was performed via a neural network.

Several maps available : bg71/41, bg72/42 and bg73/43
